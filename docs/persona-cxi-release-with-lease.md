# PERSONA — "CXI Release-with-lease"

## Snapshot
- **Role**: Senior Release Manager for CXI platform launches
- **Tenure**: 6 years coordinating multi-team SaaS releases
- **Location**: Remote (US-based), works across North America and EMEA time zones
- **Reporting to**: Director of Product Operations
- **Primary tools**: CXI Launch Console, Jira, Slack, Confluence, Netlify Deploy Previews, internal analytics dashboards

## Core Goals
1. Ship CXI features to enterprise customers on a predictable, low-risk cadence.
2. Maintain auditable release notes, approvals, and rollback plans that satisfy compliance checkpoints.
3. Translate qualitative feedback collected in the CXI interview workflow into actionable release-readiness signals.
4. Keep stakeholder communication (customer success, marketing, engineering, support) synchronized before and after each release window.

## Responsibilities
- Curate the CXI release calendar, aligning feature flags and backend changes with marketing commitments.
- Run “go/no-go” checkpoints that blend engineering confidence scores with CXI interview-derived sentiment metrics.
- Facilitate dry-runs using the interactive demo site to rehearse launch day steps.
- Publish post-release retrospectives highlighting customer experience wins and debt uncovered from the CXI data lake.
- Own the escalation path for incidents in the first 48 hours after a release ships.

## Motivations
- Delivering repeatable launches that feel calm and orchestrated rather than heroic.
- Using structured CXI insights to defend scope changes when customer experience risk climbs.
- Coaching squads on how to instrument features so CXI telemetry tells a complete story on day one.

## Frustrations & Pain Points
- Fragmented tooling: data from CXI interviews, QA sign-off, and analytics often lives in separate systems.
- Late-breaking scope creep that jeopardizes signed-off release bundles.
- Time-zone friction with globally distributed engineers and customer councils.
- Difficulty turning long-form CXI interviews into crisp executive summaries for the change review board.

## Communication Style
- Prefers asynchronous briefs with clear decision points; leverages Slack huddles only when blockers linger.
- Shares weekly "release-with-lease" digest that pairs deployment status with CXI signal health.
- Values dashboards that surface trend deltas rather than static snapshots.

## Success Metrics
- <2% rollback rate per quarter.
- Release readiness scores (weighted blend of CXI sentiment, QA coverage, and support preparedness) at ≥ 85% before launch.
- Stakeholder satisfaction (surveyed via CXI workflow) averaging 4.4/5 across the quarter.
- Time-to-mitigate for high severity incidents under 30 minutes.

## How the CXI Demo Supports Them
- **Interview Simulator**: Rehearses stakeholder Q&A using realistic CXI response prompts to pressure-test release messaging.
- **Results Dashboard**: Aggregates NSS and richness metrics that roll directly into launch readiness scorecards.
- **Export Workbench**: Generates executive-ready summaries for the change review board with consistent formatting.

## Opportunities for Enhancement
- Auto-tag transcripts with release risk themes to cut prep time for the "release-with-lease" digest.
- Integrate deployment telemetry so readiness view includes live Netlify/CI status without tab-switching.
- Add persona-based guided tours within the demo to help other release managers adopt best practices quickly.
